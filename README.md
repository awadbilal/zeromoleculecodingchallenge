# My Movies

The purpose of this project is to showcase the movies list that has been added as a user, hence, displaying the list of movies the user has added.
This project has been created as a coding challenge provided to me by Zero Molecule organization and has taken me to complete approximately 10 hours to develop from A-Z and fix bugs along the way.
